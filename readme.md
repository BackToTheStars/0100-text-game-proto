This is the "Beads Game", a game of associations, described by H. Hesse in 1943, for which he got a Nobel Prize for literature in 1946. 

It is a powerful general-purpose logic system, aimed for the creation of new knowledge. 

Ted Nelson began speaking about a similar project, "Xanadu" in the 60s of the 20th century, but did not roll out the software from his garage for mass usage.

"Palantir" uses a somewhat similar idea, but it is closed for public customers and used by intelligence and corporations only.

Alexandra Elbakyan with her "Science Hub" project told in her interviews, that we need a system, which will be able to connect science papers one to another in chains, with links, to visually see the path of thought, that this will drastically speed up the science progress and hence the progress of our civilization. 

The idea is simple. Today's news, articles, books, video interviews, etc. are not connected into the long chains, or "logic graphs". The system is just not there yet. It's time to build this system. You could see it in many movies, but it's always shown offline, on a kind of messy corkboard with papers. 
 
We are building the online version of it.

It is the very beginning of my prototype - the infinite game field, any types of content, red lines of logic, quotes, comments, question. Synthesis of new thoughts. 

Custom classes, search, spectators watching the debates, professors, generals, philosophers arguing with each other. One can play alone, or with friends, or 30 people can play together.

For example, a professor of Stanford Hoover Institution discussing the "Cold War" with the USSR with his 30 best students and professors of MGU in Russia, Moscow. Or, let's say BLM activists discussing the influence of Reggae music and Bob Marley dreads to Rastafari religion of Ethiopia, and its connection with the "Kebra Nagast" sacred book, and the stolen Arc of Covenant. 

Organizing the arguments into the logic graphs, as their natural thinking progresses along with the talks. We call these trees "Natural Thinking Graphs" (as opposed to Artificial Intelligence). 

We as humans have a lot of tools of analysis, disassembly, partitioning of knowledge (Newton & Descartes methods), the problem is that we don't have systems, aimed to reverse the process: to merge, to integrate, to blend, to combine, to understand the knowledge as a whole. 

This system allows us to do exactly that.


Launch:
1) Switch to the branch «master» 
2) cd server 
3) npm i (install dependencies for server)
4) cd .., cd client
5) npm i (install dependencies for client)
6) cd ..
7) insert .env file into the root directory, with a connection string to Mongo Atlas database
8) npm run dev (1st terminal, starts server)
9) npm run webpack (2nd terminal, starts client)
