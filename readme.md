Ted Nelson began speaking about a similar project, "Xanadu" in 60s of a 20th century, but did not roll out the software from his garage. 

The idea is very simple. Today's news, articles, books, video interviews etc. are not connected into the long chains, or "logic graphs". System is just not there yet. It's time to build this system. You could see it in many movies but it's always shown offline, on a kind of messy cork board with papers. 
 
I am building the online version of it.

This is a very beginning of my prototype - the infinite game field, any types of content, red lines of logic, quotes, comments, question. Synthesis of a new thoughts. 

Custom classes, search, spectators watching the games, professors, generals, philosophers arguing with each other. One can play alone, or with friends, or 30 people can play together, for example, professor of Stanford Hoover Institution discussing Cold War with USSR with his 30 best students and professors of MGU in Russia, Moscow, or, let's say BLM activists discussing the influence of reggae music and Bob Marley dreads to Rastafarai religion of Ethiopia, and its connection with Kebra Nagast sacred book, and the stolen Arc of Covenant. 

Organizing the arguments into the logic graphs, as their natural thinking progresses along the talks. 

We have a lot of tools of analysis, disassembly, partitioning of knowledge (Newton & Descartes methods), the problem is that we don't really have any systems, which are aimed to reverse the process, to merge, to integrate, to blend, to combine, to understand the knowledge as a whole. This system does exactly that.

It is a same "Beads Game", game of associations, described by H. Hesse in 1943, for which he got a Nobel Prize for literature in 1946.

Long story short, it is a powerful general purpose logic system, aimed for creation of new knowledge. I call it these trees "Natural Thinking Graphs" (as opposed to Artificial Intelligence).
